# DATA MINNING
> INTRODUCTION<br>
Data Minning
: **Data mining** is a technique where we extract useful information from the raw data that we have. Data
Mining comes under Data Science. In DBMS we store and retrieve the data as per our requirement
by using Database queries.<br>
### Then a question arises in learners that what is the use of Data mining?<br>
By Database queries we can only retrieve the data that was given by the user. If there is scenario
where we must analyze the data and conclude which part of the data is useful and which part is not,
then Database queries are not going to work out in such situation. This situation can be handled by
using data mining whereby this technique we can predict the data by analyzing the previous data. By
Data Mining we can extract essence of information that is available and generate report, views or
summary of data for better decision making.

### For example 
: In google we get the recommendations related to the data that we search in the browser
most of the time. They analyze the data that the user is interested most of the time and predict the
user’s interest by going through his browse history. This job is done by Data mining. Data Mining
is also known as KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) which refers to the broad procedure of
discovering knowledge in the data and emphasizes the high-level applications of specific Data
Mining techniques.<br>
### Process of Data Mining
Data mining is an iterative process and it goes through the following phases laid down by Cross
Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CISP-DM) process model:
### Importance of Data Mining 
1. Data Mining helps to find out the customer behavior towards a business.
2. It helps in making crucial decisions for the company’s growth.
3. It helps in gaining the competitive advantage over other businesses.
